about: In short a Tech nerd.I was Born in India,in late 1996, I was fortunate enough to grow up with the rapid 
       changes in technology. I got to witness the end of some technologies and the advent of other 
       technologies. The first computer language I learned was HTML - back when MySpace was a thing and 
       you could customize profiles by embedding HTML. This happened at the age of 12. After buffing up a bit
       on HTML in high school, my first year of college unfolded and Java was the second computer language I 
       learned. Ever since then, I have considered myself devoted to computer science. ‚ù§
